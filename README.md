## Frances Anscombe

Anscombe's quartet comprises of four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, but seem to appear to be very different when graphed. Each piece of data has eleven (x & y) points. 
There are 8 variables representing four pairings of an outcome and a predictor.
They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe, to show how important it was to graph data before analysing it. Frances Anscome was educated at Trinity college at Cambridege university.

Before this he had served in the second world war and spent two years at the Rothamsted experimental station beofre going back to Cambridge university to lecture. 
in his design phase he believed that experiments should randomize the labelsof blocks, in the anlsysis phase. He said that this phase should guide the analysis of data. His approach has influenced many people over the years. 
He moved to Princeton university in 1956 and was elected as a fellow of the americal statistical association.
He was the founder of the statistics department at Yale university in 1963.

##Statistics department at Yale university

Residuals in linear regeression in 1961 is known as one of his greates works, his suggestion earlier that variance stabilizing transformation for Poisson data was known as the Anscombes transform. 
He soon became intersted in statistical and stresseda computer should make both calcualtions and graphs and also by using the 4 sets of data known as Anscombes quarted would be the most effective and effeicient way of doing this. 
He believed that numerical calculations were exact and that graphs were rough. 
## Calculating the descriptive statistics of the variables in the data set.Below is a  summary of the statistics of the data set.
## This is the data for all four sets

We have done a summary of the statistics of the data set. The data used in the data set had a mean of x(9) and y(7.5), the same fitted regression line(y = 3 ++ 0.5x), has the same regressiona and residual sum of squares thus giving it the same multiple R-squared of 0.67.  After reviewing the statsitical data forma mathematics view you could imagine how the data would look plotted, that how could it be very different it couldnt

Below we have a table holding a vast amount of information regarding the anscombes data set we have calculated the count, the mean, standard deviation, max and the min and also the 75%, 25% and so on to give us a clearer overall picture of this particular dataset.

But this was what was surprising and shows why Anscombes Data set is so important in understanding the use of graphs in statistical analysis.

### R squared is 0.666 in all four of the data sets but as you can see especially by the fourth set where is the slope is completley determined by the observation on the right. If we did not have that observation we would not be able to get the regression as all of the x,s would be the same as each other.

Visuals in data analysis is very effective and efficient in showing people quickly large ammounts of data. It can also give more insight into the data and allow for a solution and a new understanding more quickly. it works more effectively with large ammounts of data but is effective in all data sizes.
Plots should give a picture of the data and help show what exactly is happeneing, allows large amounts of data to be shown in an easily understood picture, must be coherent and serve a clear purpose.

A somewhat related phenomenon is the cherry picking of facts to suit a preconceived notion. As Sherlock
Holmes warns, “It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts
to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts” (Doyle, 2003, p. 189.

 As you can see from the data below how close statistically they are, again brings home how important to both plot and measure mathematically.

##Here we can see a visual comparison of how statistically they may be the same when put on a graph can be so disimilar.

Below you can see instantly how the four plots line up making them look very simple but in reality a very comlex set of data

From researching the Anscombes data set we have seen numerous accounts of reasons for the data set but Anscombe himself believed that computers should both do calculations and graphs to understand the data in full and get a clear understanding of what is going on. he believed in graphical representations and showing not just the data but the distance also form the regression lines, which are also known as the residuals, and any other information that will help understand the data clearer and how the model fits.

As you can see visually from the plots below us it is a real representaion of the dat structure.

This method and way of thinking was not everyday workings in this field of IT, it was definitely thinking outside the box for the 1970's even tho one would think it obvious now.


Alber Cairo created the Datasaurus, bring home the point you should never trust summary statisitics on their own, that you must always visualise the data, shoing below that normal looking statisitics may not always be what they seem as this particular set of data plots a dinosaur image!!!! Which was inspired by Anscombes data set.
