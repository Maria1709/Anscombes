##Anscombe's quartet comprises of four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, but seem to appear to be very different when graphed. Each piece of data has eleven (x & y) points. 
##There are 8 variables representing four pairings of an outcome and a predictor.
##They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe, to show how important it was to graph data before analysing it. 
##He believed that numerical calculations were exact and that graphs were rough. 
##the data used in the data set had a mean of x(9) and y(7.5), the same fitted regression line(y = 3 ++ 0.5x), has the same regressiona and residual sum of squares thus giving it the same multiple R-squared of 0.67. 
##After reviewing the statsitical data forma mathematics view you could imagine how the data would look plotted, that how could it be very different it couldnt

##But this was what was surprising and shows why Anscombes Data set is so important in understanding the use of graphs in statistical analysis.
Visuals in data analysis is very effective and efficient in showing people quickly large ammounts of data. It can also give more insight into the data and allow for a solution and a new understanding more quickly. it works more effectively with large ammounts of data but is effective in all data sizes.
##Plots should give a picture of the data and help show what exactly is happeneing, allows large amounts of data to be shown in an easily understood picture, must be coherent and serve a clear purpose.

##A somewhat related phenomenon is the cherry picking of facts to suit a preconceived notion. As Sherlock
Holmes warns, “It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts
to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts” (Doyle, 2003, p. 189.
